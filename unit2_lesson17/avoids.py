#Define function and its two inputs (the word and forbidden letters)


    #loop through each letter in the word


        #If a letter is in the string that is forbidden, return false




    #If the function completes, there are no forbidden letters and the function
    #may return True.


#Call the function to make it run! Print the result to see what happens.
